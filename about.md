Hi! I'm [Rahul Rajeev](https://www.instagram.com/rdrawsstuff/), and this is my public repository of notes.

I'm a writer and an artist, currently learning more abour UX Design. I love writing and drawing in the broadest of terms. I am passionate about many things. Right now I am exploring the ideas in topics such as transformative tools for thought, meta cognition, essentialism, GTD, stoicism, zettlekkasten and learning methodologies.


Contrary to what you may thing, this is in no form or shape a blog. This is my public zettlekasten, where I write to think about topics that I am exposed to and deeply care about. If there are empty notes or missing content it is because I haven't reached there yet. I hope to write more polished versions of the things I encounter as long form essays in my [Blog](https://medium.com/@rahulrajeev9)


If you want to know more about Zettlekasten and thinking-through-writing Sonke Ahrens Make [Smart Notes](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WVYW33Y/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0) is a good place to start.
