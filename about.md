Hi! I'm [Rahul Rajeev](https://blog.rahulrajeev.net/), and this is my public repository of notes.

I'm a writer and an artist, currently learning more about UX Design. I love writing and drawing in the broadest of terms. I am passionate about many things. Right now I am exploring the ideas in topics such as transformative tools for thought, meta cognition, essentialism, GTD, stoicism, zettlekkasten and learning methodologies.


Contrary to what you may thing, this is in no form or shape a blog. This is my public zettlekasten, where I write to think about topics that I am exposed to and deeply care about. If there are empty notes or missing content it is because I haven't reached there yet. I hope to write more polished versions of the things I encounter as long form essays in my [Blog](https://blog.rahulrajeev.net/)


If you want to know more about Zettlekasten and thinking-through-writing Sonke Ahrens Make [Smart Notes](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WVYW33Y/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0) is a good place to start.


### This is a temporary setup
I had not idea what I was doing when I started a github account for the very first time back in March. I got so attracted into the digital garden movement I wanted to make one asap. That's when I picked up jekyll and forked for this site for myself.

### Now
I am working on a logseq plus osbidian workflow for a personal zettelkasten system. I intend to use a bash script to extract permanent notes from to make a much more polished digital garden soon.


### Credit list
Ali Abdaal for introducing me to  world of productivity, after which I began exploring ideas with intent and direction. And also Hiran, whoose own [working notes frame work](https://notes.hiran.in/) I have used to start this project. To all the members of open source community for sharing their knowledge out in the open so that noobs like me can play with git and cook up something like this.
