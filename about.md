Hi! I'm [Hiran Venugopalan](https://hiran.in), and this Notes.Hiran is mix of Digital Garden and [Zettelkasten](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/note-taking-zettelkasten/) method.

**Working Notes** are atomic notes with backlink to other notes. **Context** are notes that works as tags, you can see all connected working notes listed under that as backlink. **Ideas** contains what I learned, more like Zettel permanent notes.

### The #Workflow

After using Evernote and Notion for years, I recently moved to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as it stores text content as  plain [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files. Notes are created using Obsidian, Atom Editor or using [1Writer](https://1writerapp.com/) and is stored in my private [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/AABugyzJkQG2BLMNM8UnJqsWLyl30OUkSFc?src=global9). Part of that note (Except my Private Vault, Kindle Hightlight and Experimental Weekly Journal) gets synced to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which renders this page using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

If you see any broken links (one with the yellow highlight or hashtags), it's either a bug or a link to other folders and tags in my Obsidian, which are not public. _And in case if it asks for any password, try ‡¥µ‡¥æ‡¥™‡µç‡¥™‡¥ö‡µç‡¥ö‡¥ø‡¥Ø‡µÅ‡¥ü‡µÜ‡¥≤‡µÜ‡¥ó‡¥∏‡¥ø, ‡¥π‡µã‡¥≥‡¥ø‡¥¨‡µà‡¥¨‡¥ø‡µæ, etc. üôàüôâüôä_
