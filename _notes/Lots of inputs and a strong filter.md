notetype : lit

- Reading same authors on same topics helps more on confirmation [[bias]]. It limits our ability and changes to connect between different thoughts, perspective and fields. 
- If a book is not working, slam it shut and move on. 
- Itâ€™s better to be selective and read fewer, better articles than to be indiscriminate and read zilch.
