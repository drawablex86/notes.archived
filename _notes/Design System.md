Design System is a collection of reusable [[Components]], build using [[Atomic]] and Sub-atomic [[Design Tokens]] particles that follow the guideline, behave consistently, and together work as the building block of the product.

A design system is not a pattern library or a sticker sheet. Atoms being consistent or similar in a design system won't make the final result compatible. For that, it requires a clear documented guideline on behavior and usage patterns. Usage patterns, organisms and templates makes system scalable [[Design is Scaling]]. 

Design system is like Lego, but does come with some, themes and rules. *The combinations are not endless.*

Consider the design system as the single source of truth which groups all the elements that will allow the teams to design, realize and develop a product.

Start with [[Pilots & Scorecards]] instead of over planning and under achieving.
