### Devices
I use Mac Book Pro provided by Office for all primary purposes and iPad Pro 2020 for personal requirements. Google Pixel 3a is my only phone, with [Before Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beforesoft.launcher&hl=en_IN&gl=US) and [95% notifications turned off](https://medium.com/make-time/six-years-with-a-distraction-free-iphone-8cf5eb4f97e3). For reading, I use a 2013 [Kindle Paperwhite](https://amzn.to/3nGZ5nY).

### Bullet Journal
I started [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn) back in 2015 and tried using multiple notebooks. Of all, the favorite is [Matrikas](https://amzn.to/3rdBa1r). But for 2021, I am looking for a smaller book with some reusable function - hence I choose to go with [Pennline Quikrite](https://amzn.to/2KG9uBJ). After years of thinking, I bought a [TWSBI Eco](https://amzn.to/3h2FLyU) Fountain pen, which I use with [Pelikan Brilliant Brown](https://amzn.to/2WAB6dX) Ink.

### Designing
I started my design career with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), and I still use them. For a while I shifted to Adobe tools until I found [Sketchapp](https://www.sketch.com/). I don't own Adobe or Sketch license for the last year, as I am using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for all screen design requirements. Also, I have [Procreate App](https://procreate.art/) on my iPad, but that's too French for me!

### Note-Taking
I was never a note-taker, but someone who jot down about interesting URLs I visited (especially WordPress themes from Theme forest). [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) was my tool of choice until my requirement changed (and Evernote became bulky). Later, I started building it with [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) ([Notion was my Project Manager and ToDo list and everything](https://hfactor.medium.com/focus-dashboard-simple-notion-template-for-task-objective-and-resource-management-42164d855789)). Some accidental missing of data and formatting issues made me search for an alternative, and I ended up at [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which stores information as [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

These days, I am trying to build a [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/), with a subset published as working notes. Other than Obsidian, I use [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/home), [1writer](https://1writerapp.com/), [Github](https://github.com/), and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to set up this **[subset digital garden.](https://notes.hiran.in/)**

_This page is also powered by an Obsidian Markdown, stored in Github, thanks to developers of [Documents from Git](https://wordpress.org/plugins/documents-from-git/) WordPress Plugin_

### Reading
While I have tried products like [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/), [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/), and [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) once in a while, I am not still in-sync with those systems. [Telegram's 'Saved Message'](https://telegram.org/blog/albums-saved-messages) does the magic for me. 

For Kindle, I convert highlight clippings using [clippings.io](https://www.clippings.io/) and [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/). (Bookmark files are not modified, as I need loc details to refer it again)

### Listening
The significant usage of my mobile is to provide me audio content. I use [Audible](https://www.audible.in/) and [Storytel](https://www.storytel.com/in/en/) for Audiobook and [Voice app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.ph1b.audiobook&hl=en_IN&gl=US) in case if I need one. For Podcast, I still use [PocketCast](https://www.pocketcasts.com/), and for everything else, there is [YTMusic](https://music.youtube.com/).

### Project Management
For personal stuff, tasks, and to-do lists, go to Bullet Journal, and if there is any project that needs more, I will go with Notion. My suggestion of Project Management tools is based on usage context - if you have well-defined tasks, go for [Trello](https://trello.com/) Kanban. If you need to make some filtering and complicated tables, go for Notion. And if you are in the ideation/collaborative phase - please using [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) and NOT Google Docs.

### Malayalam Input
Malayalam is my native language, and I write and chat a lot using that. [Indic Keyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.smc.inputmethod.indic&hl=en&gl=US) for Android, [Varamozhi](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/varamozhi/id514987251)  for iPad, and [Keymagic](https://junix.in/keymagic-with-malayalam/) for Mac are my current choice of tools.

### Misc Apps
For personal data storage, I use [PCloud](https://my.pcloud.com/) and [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/home). Also, on Mac, I use [Flow](https://flowapp.info/) for Pomodoro, [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) to arrange windows, and [Simple note](https://simplenote.com/) for quick notes.

### Website
This website uses [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/download/) with [Semplice](https://www.semplice.com/) theme. [Yoast](https://yoast.com/), [Documents from Git](https://wordpress.org/plugins/documents-from-git/), and [Akismet](https://akismet.com/) are the only plugins I use. [Notes.Hiran](https://notes.hiran.in/) uses Github and Jekyll with the [SimplyJekyll](https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/simply-jekyll) theme.
