As NASA released the statement declaring the first successful flight of "Ingenuity" - the first man-made helicopter to take flight on another planet, scientists and space geeks erupted with joy and elation all over the world. Ingenuity takes us one step closer to the all-time human aspiration to explore planets other than Earth.

But then there is a lot of people, from different backgrounds that have come and dished out scathing criticism for this multi-billion project. This isn't anything new. For every major scientific leap, there are people who try to undermine the achievement of the hour with the same recurring arguments over and over.

In Ingenuity's case, a popular argument I have seen is that the money spent on this project could have helped millions of people across the globe. Partially itâ€™s true, you can indeed change people's lives with money, the problem is you don't need the money dedicated to scientific research and advancement for solving social problems. That money should come from other sources, after all, capitalism is never short of money if you know where to look.

While welfare spending focuses on the human condition today, spending on research provides solutions for today and tomorrow as well. As a species, today and tomorrow are both important frontiers for us to explore and be prepared for.

Now the "spending" argument against Ingenuity is just one of the many criticisms. Instead of addressing each of such arguments, it is much easier to confront the question of why Ingenuity matters and what does it mean for humanity and humans like you and me? Because addressing each argument is a waste of my time and without understanding why projects such as ingenuity exist, people will continue to develop more fallible, inaccurate, shrewd and dumb arguments.

But like all things to know the what, you must understand the why? and the how?

# The Human Ingenuity behind "Ingenuity"
Yes, we have successfully flown a small helicopter-like drone over the surface of a different planet - Mars. So what's the big deal here? Your cousin's wedding probably had a dozen drones whizzing past all the time to capture stunning 4k video!

If you really think about it, it is not a dumb question to ask, with the kind of commercial drones we have on sale on sites such as Amazon. Hell, you can build a drone all by yourself if you have the patience to follow some clear step by step instruction available on the internet.

In fact, Ingenuity is mostly built out of commercially available drone components. But what makes Ingenuity truly a milestone of human progress is the fact that your cousin's wedding occured on Earth which has a "thick" asf atmosphere to help with the lift of the drones while Ingenuity made the lift in the Martian atmoshphere which is only around 0.6 percent of Earth's atmosphere.

Still don't get it, do you? 0.6 percent is the kind of air pressure you would experience at a height of 100,000 ft. To put it in perspective, the highest altitude recorded for a helicopter on Earth is at 40,000 ft.

To summarize Ingenuity is an engineering milestone, combining our advancements in material science, power transmission, solar technology, long-distance communication, automation and imagination.

## The Challenges it had to solve
As I described earlier, the low atmosphere in Mars was a formidable challenge. So how did the scientists in NASA and JPL (Jet Propulsion Lab) tackle it?

They made the drone small, which is self-explanatory.  The smaller and lighter the object, the easier it is to achieve the lift. Advancements in material science came to the rescue here. The team worked on creating parts that were strong enough for martian conditions at the same time with a lower density. Nasa has reported the weight of Ingenuity to be at 1.8 Kilograms.

Now, being lighter does not make the job any less difficult. To achieve lift and maintain flight for few seconds, Ingenuity needed its roter to spin ridiculously fast - 2300 to 2800 rpm. Yet another challenge for the design team to bear. 

The spin rate was achieved nevertheless with the use of eight electric motors:
- One Brushless DC Motor to spin each of the two rotors
- Three Brushed DC Motors for each rotor to actuate their ["swash plate"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swashplate_(aeronautics)).

*The sheer advancement in power transmission and generation can be seen in the fact that each of these motors is only two inches in diameter*

Then there is the need to have batteries that can provide the required power to these motors. Luckily it wasn't hard to find one given how capable modern batteries have become. But the engineers did have to account for the chilling Martian nights. To keep the batteries from freezing they are house is specially designed thermal paddings.

No battery is incomplete without a charging solution. The tiny helicopter also has its own solar panel to generate the energy it needs to fly and also keep itself warm during the night. At this point, I would just be repeating myself by saying that mankind's advancements in solar panel technologies have also come in handy in this historic mission.

Even though all these challenges were there, the fascinating thing is that all the components used in ingenuity are cellular phone class. The engineers had to test these to see if they could function in highly radiated environments. All they had to was to combine these components with some clever technical optimisations and algorithmic calculations.

The biggest challenge before the JPT team was not the helicopter itself, but our ability to fly the thing from a command centre on Earth. Unlike other challenges, this was not a problem that can be readily solved. The time delay between Earth and Mars is far too great to make a controlled flight. So the only solution was to give the helicopter the ability to fly autonomously.

As we look at this topic after the completion of the flight, it feels only natural. But until it happened we did not know if this was even going to work. Ingenuity managed to fly on its own, without a human on its steering wheels. A tiny machine, on a faraway planet, on different terrain, with a weak atmosphere managing to rise up, doing what no other rover has done before - the ability to map terrain from an areal perspective.

## What does this means to us, the human species and you and me?
When I began writing this, my sole focus was on ingenuity. The question was to address what makes it special from an engineering/technological standpoint and from an anthropological point. But now I realise it would be rather unwise to look at ingenuity in isolation to answer these questions. Yes, from the engineering side the tiny machine showed us what we can do, and where our current technology is. It even showed us that as a civilisation the technology we have on our hands as smartphones and cameras and drone are almost space ready. But these are all bread crumbs of what is possible and how there is a chance for a broader vision for our combined future.

To answer the anthropological question of why this matter, we should be thinking about Perseverance, Curiosity and the whole Mars mission. When Sojourner made its first journey on the Moon's surface it was history. The machine could survive and do what we couldn't. Rovers have played a crucial part in collecting the samples and conducting experiments needed for us to understand the mysteries of space science.

And now we have the Ingenuity to look at Mars from a new perspective, to see what rovers in the ground cannot see.
