As NASA released the statement declaring the first successful flight of "Ingenuity" - the first microcopter to take flight on an another planet, scientists and space geeks erupted with joy and elation all over the world. Ingenuity takes us one step closer to the all time human aspiration to explore planets other than Earth.

But then there are a lof of people, from different backgrounds that has come and dished out scathing criticisinm for this multi billion project. This isn't anything new. For every major scientific leap there are people who tries to undermine the achievement of the hour with the same recurring arguments over and over.

In Ingenuity's case a popular argument I have seen is that, the money spend towards this project could have helped millions of people across the globe. Partially its true, you can indeed change people's life with money, the problem is you don't need the money dedicated for scientific research and advancement for solving social problems. That money should come from other sources, after all, capitalism is never short of money if you know where to look.

While welfare spending focuses on human condition today, spending on research provides solutions for today and tomorrow as well. As a species today and tomorrow are both important frontiers for us to explore and be prepared for.

Now the "spending" argument against Ingenuity is just one of the many criticisms. Instead of addressing each of such arguments it is much easier to confront the question of why Ingenuity matters and what does it mean for humanity and humans like you and me? Because addressing each argument is a waste of my time and without understanding why projects such as ingenuity exists, people will continue to develop more fallible, inacccurate, shrewed and dumb arguments.

But like all things to know the what, you must understand the why? and the how?

# The Human Ingenuity behind "Ingenuity"
Yes, we have succesfully flown a small helcopter like drone over the surface of a different planet - Mars. So what's the big deal here? Your cousin's wedding probably had a dozen drones whizzing past all the time to capture stunning 4k video!

If you really think about it, it is not a dumb question to ask, with the kind of commercial drones we have on sale on sites such as Amazon. Hell, you can build a drone all by yourself if you have the patience to follow some clear step by step instruction available on the internet.

Infact, Ingenuity is mostly build out of commercially available drone components. But what makes Ingenuity truly a milestone of human progress is the fact that your cousin's wedding occured on Earth which has a "thick" asf atmosphere to help with the lift of the drones while Ingenuity made the lift in the Martian atmoshphere which is only around 0.6 percent of Earth's atmosphere.

Still don't get it do you? 0.6 percent is the kind of air pressure you would experience at a height of 100,000 ft. To put in perspective, the highest altitude recorded for a helicopter on Earth is at 40,000 ft.

To summarize Ingenuity is an engineering milestone, combining our advancements in material science, power transmission, solar technology, long distance communication, automation and imagination.

## The Challenges it had to solve
As I described earlier, the low atmosphere in Mars was a formidable challenge. So how did the scientists in NASA and JPL (Jet Propulsion Lab) tackle it?

They made the drone small, which is self explanatory.  Smaller and lighter the object, easier to achieve the lift. Advacements in material science came to the rescue here. The team worked on creating parts that were strong enough for martian conditions at the same time with a lower denisty. Nasa has reported the weight of Ingenuity to be at 1.8 Kilograms.

Now, being lighter does not make the job any less difficult. To achieve lift and maintain flight for few seconds, Ingenuity needed its roter to spin ridiculously fast - 2300 to 2800 rpm. Yet another challenge for the design team to bear. 

The spin rate was achieved nevertheless with the use of eight electric motors:
- One Brushless DC Motor to spin each of the two rotors
- Three Brushed DC Motors for each rotor to actuate their ["swash plate"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swashplate_(aeronautics)).

*The sheer advancement in power transmission and generation can be be seen in the fact that each of these motors is only two inches in diameter*
