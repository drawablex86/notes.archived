- In normal [[Â§NoteTaking]], we sort by topics and sub-topics, which is usable, but reduces the chance of connecting two random ideas. (which reduces it's usability).

- [[Figma]]'s variant, by changing component properties from parent-child structure to a key value pair, it is solving a similar problem.
