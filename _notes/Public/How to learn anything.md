The session by futur on how to learn anything was incredible useful in clarifying certain approaches that I need to implement in my life asap.

Learn-Unlearn-Relearn This is the motto that futur pushes towards the idea of learning in 21st century' similar to how scientists have to constantly change their understanding of subjects when new discoveries comes to sight.

Three must-have aspects of [[Learning]]:

##  Reflect
Usually we consume knowledge on a regular basis without ever stopping to reflect on it. I realise I am a victim of this habit, especially to the idea called intellectual self-gratification. I have listened to numerous podcasts, audiobooks and tutorials jumping from one after the other, in false pretence of quickly absorbing its core principle. While I do retain some of the information from it, as I consume more, most of these dissolves into the background as abstract concepts. So reflection is integral when it comes to learning.

Additional points on reflection:
1.  What was most useful to me from what I have listened here.
2.  How might I apply this in my life and work
3.  Cross referencing with multiple sources to further improve the reflection and reach at a point where you have your own opinion regarding the topic.
    
## Implement
 Fairly the most straight forward of the three aspects. Like what I am doing right now, I have reflected on the topic and have taken the steps to write these down as my reaction to the call to action. I hope to implement the ideas further by incorporating these in my everyday life.

## Sharing
Sharing Once you have reflected and implemented on what you have learned it's time to share it. Sharing is the best way to articulate what you have learned and also identify whatever gap is there in your learning. 1 TEACHES 2 LEARN! Sharing can be either as a tweet, or a blog post, or a YouTube video or a podcast. It doesn't need you to be a master of the subject to share your knowledge, the attempt will help you time stamp your intellectual growth over time.

Personally the sharing part might be the biggest road block that I am facing right now. I hesitate putting things out in the world, over the fear that it will make me seem dumb to a loads of people. It is something I will need to face upto.

## ANALYSIS OF STYLE
This one particularly focused towards creatives, aimed at teaching them how to see properly. Seeing in terms of observation is probably the hardest thing you can do as a beginner. Here is how you can analysis a picture or a scene to "see" it better:

-   Identify 5 points of individuality in that piece
-   The points should not be too specific nor broad
-   Based on those 5 points you should be able to extrapolate the next scene that the original artist might create

This sort of analysis helps you breakdown a masterpiece and identify what makes it special to you. Identification will help you give a goal for yourself to set hopes for. The mere act of identifying the smaller factors will empower you to work more, than get lost in the higher than life nature of the master piece.

I find something similar to discussed by Marshall and Stan in [Draftsmen](https://player.fm/series/draftsmen) podcast that talks about discovering your art parents.
