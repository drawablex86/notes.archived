Making notes is the easiest part when it comes to knowledge management. Links, Wikipedia, copy-paste, kindle highlights - all can be considered as notes.The idea of note taking is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions.

**More Notes â‰  More Output.**

Principles I follow : 
- Make [[Atomic]] notes, one concept per note. 
- Write in my own words. Mark #ðŸ”–quote at source
- Link notes, but don't try to build a Section Subsection relation 
- No Tags, No Categorization use notes with MOC instead of tags. 
- Use Hashtags to mark states, not to build category.
