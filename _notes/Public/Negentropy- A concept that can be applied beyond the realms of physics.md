## What is Negentropy?
- Negentropy is a construct drawn from physics that can be conceptualized as the opposite of energy losses associated with normal organizational life.
- It can be a powerful tool for sustainable, progressive models of organizational advancement.
- **Negentropy in Physics**
	- The second law essentially expresses the understanding of decay or energy loss within an organization over time
	- Entropy, then, is the mathematical measure of how much decay has taken place within a system, as well as how that energy loss accelerates over time.
	-  Entropy is a measure of how much [energy](https://phys.org/tags/energy/) is lost in a system.
	- _Negentropy is negetive entropy_
	- _Add a clear definition for negentropy_


## How does negentropy relate to organisations?
- _Organisations can be seen as systems with energy losses_
- Losses are constant
- Losses leads to frustration
- It can be  a tool to fight energy loss and consequent organizational disintegration.
- As we see energy leaving a system, we need to understand how, if possible, we can add energy to the system or recapture the lost energy.
-  Once identified, ways to combat energy losses can be explicitly trained as a set of skills
-  Within organizations, energy draining and energy creating behaviors can happen at all levels and within all sectors.

## Problems of high entropy - chaotic systems
- _Builds up frustration_
- _Break down of communication_
- _Low efficiency_
- can even build to a point where good employees start quitting.



## What breaks an organisation?
- _Its openness_
- _More open a system is more energy loses it will have_
- Most organizations actively lose energy until they reach a prolonged period of inactivity, also called “statis.”
- As an organisation system becomes more open, its entropy increases leading to unstability
- _A more open organisation_ can be described as “dissipative” structures. They are  far from a balanced or equilibrium state


## Are dissipative or open structures bad?
- _Yes and No_
- Two things can happen:
	1. The organisation could die
	2. It can trigger a significant new innovation
	
	### How?
	- A dissipative structure maintains itself far from equilibrium and may even move farther and farther away from it through a series of bifurcations.  
	-  At the bifurcation points, conditions of higher order…may emerge spontaneously”
	-  _Define bifurification_ (exiting from the status quo)
	-  it might need to consider a bifurication point and it involves a dramatic restructuring
	
	### Why?
	- _Parallels in nature_
		- “In living systems, the order arising from nonequilibrium is far more evident, being manifest in the richness, diversity and beauty of life all around us. Throughout the living world, chaos is transformed into order”
	- *We imagine order is equilibrium. But dramatic change can be a source of new order (efficient and higher)*
	- open systems, where intelligence is diffused or spread to all members of the organization, will tend to make better decisions, do so quickly
	-  Institute order and rigid structure, and while you may achieve standardization, you’ll also squelch creativity
	-  Where creativity is valuable, learning to accept chaos is a must


	### Challenges here
	-  *It is quite possible that we may take this restructuring as energy loss and more chaotic*


## How to apply Negetropy in organisations
- negentropic actions need not be grand, their purpose needs to be aimed at grander goals, rather than preserving the status quo.
- Distinguishing between entrepreneurism, innovation and negentropy is one part of honing this particular tool.
- include new approaches to the way work is done in an organization.
- Risky actions certainly invite plenty of failure, but actions that engage failure as a part of the process of reclaiming organizational energy rather than failure as an end are actions that we would see as negentropic.
### Steps:
- re-capture; hiring, leadership facilitation, active staff work, and training.
#### Hiring
- *Recruit Negentropic actors*: Utilizing current tools to determine creativity, growth mindset and systemic perspectives can help a great deal in determining whether someone might be effective in your organization as an energy creator.
- *achieve balance*: An organization with too many negentropic actors could produce instability amounting to a lack of focus and chasing too many bifurcation points.
#### Role of the leadership
- leadership supports energy recapture across the organization.
- Leaders should engage users in the creation of their own systems.
- less powerful actors to engage within their organizations is with the permission, encouragement and scaffolding of strong, secure leaders
- leaders  may not see the energy flows at lower levels. _But they can interview the other workers_
#### Role of the staff
- Staff have extremely important roles within organizations, particularly those that are pursuing energy-creation strategies.
- staff tend to be able to see organizational energy flows more clearly and directly than many other professionals and leaders.



## Can negentropic application actually solve your organisation's problems?
- It can if your organisational system is indeed beneficial
- Training will not solve all problems if you are actually maintaining a social system that isn't beneficial no matter how smoothly it works.
- The best way to apply the idea of negentropy to social systems is to not only improve the small processes, but also look at the big picture and see if the status quo itself promotes energy loss.



## At an individual perspective
- Life is full of small decisions
- Leaving a sock on the ground is a manifestation of a concept from physics you may have heard of: [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy).
-  It takes only a little bit of energy to pick up one sock
-  _Entropy on smaller tasks build up_ leading you into a chaotic system
-  And that chaos will leach away your [time and ability to accomplish other things](https://www.fastcompany.com/1842000/company-chaos-you-dont-know-youre-creating).
-  Seeing things through a negentropic lens won't solve a bad relationship or help you love a job you hate—those are complicated issues. However, if you begin to notice where energy is lost in your life, it will be easier to prioritize and act in ways that can improve the [social systems](https://phys.org/tags/social+systems/) around you.
