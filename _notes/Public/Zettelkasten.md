Zettelkasten (Slipbox) recommends creating independent, [[Atomic]] notes so that we can connect it with other ideas and build new ideas. It creates a graph structure. Topic sub-topic format of note taking looks easier, but [[Usable doesn't always result in usefulness]]. 

- Start with **Fleeting notes**, temporary reminders of ideas - terms, jargons, examples - like kindle highlights. 
- **Literature notes** are one idea, [[Atomic]], written in own words, explained and written to provide context, even after years.
- **Permanent notes** are build over multiple lit notes. It's more like a concept/idea note, based on insights from multiple sources
- Lit notes are based on source (one to one) while Permanent notes is around concept (many to one) 
- **Keyword notes** (Map of Concepts) - An index note, a set related permanent notes. Consider it as a starting point, or index of one topic. It works as a bridge note between two similar, but unconnected notes.
