A system is a set of thingsâ€”people, cells, molecules, or whateverâ€”interconnected in such a way that they produce their own pattern of behavior over time.

A system is more than the sum of its parts. It may exhibit adaptive, dynamic, goal-seeking, self-preserving, and sometimes evolutionary behavior.
