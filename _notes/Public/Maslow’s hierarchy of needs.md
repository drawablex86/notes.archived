Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a motivational theory in psychology comprising a five-tier model of human needs, often depicted as hierarchical levels within a pyramid. 

5. Self-actualization - Top of the pyramid is more about personal growth, less concerned with the opinions of others. 
4. Esteem Needs - At this point, it becomes increasingly important to gain the respect and appreciation of others. People have a need to accomplish things and then have their efforts recognized.
3. Social Needs - the need for emotional relationships drives human behavior. Eg : Friendship. 
2. Safety Needs - People want control and order in their lives. So, this need for safety and security contributes largely to behaviors at this level. Fin Security, Health etc.
1. Physiological Needs - Bottom of the pyramid, The basic physiological needs are things that are vital to our survival. Eg : Food, Shelter. 

- Maslow believed that these needs are similar to instincts and play a major role in motivating behavior.
