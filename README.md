## About

Hi! I'm [Hiran Venugopalan](https://hiran.in), and this is a partial window to my working notes. 

**Working notes** are atomic, with backlinks to other notes. You won't see any tags or categorization, but there are **context notes** (tags are first-class citizens), which backlinks to all related atomic notes. **Outliners** might include ordered notes - more like [Zettelkasten](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/note-taking-zettelkasten/) permanent notes.

### The #Workflow

Working notes are plain [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files, created mostly using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (and sometimes directly on Github). Part of my Obsidian vault gets synced to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which renders [Notes.Hiran](https://notes.hiran.in) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 

If you see any broken links (one with the yellow highlight or hashtags), it's either a bug or a link to other folders and tags in my Obsidian, which are not public. 
_And in case if it asks for any password, try ‡¥µ‡¥æ‡¥™‡µç‡¥™‡¥ö‡µç‡¥ö‡¥ø‡¥Ø‡µÅ‡¥ü‡µÜ‡¥≤‡µÜ‡¥ó‡¥∏‡¥ø, ‡¥π‡µã‡¥≥‡¥ø‡¥¨‡µà‡¥¨‡¥ø‡µæ, etc. üôàüôâüôä_
