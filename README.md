## About

Hi! I'm [Rahul Rajeev](https://blog.rahulrajeev.net/), and this is "sort of a" blog that I am trying to create. 

**Working notes** are atomic, with backlinks to other notes. You won't see any tags or categorization, but there are **context notes** (tags are first-class citizens), which backlinks to all related atomic notes. **Outliners** might include ordered notes - more like [Zettelkasten](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/note-taking-zettelkasten/) permanent notes.



### Credit list
Ali Abdaal for introducing me to  world of productivity, through which I was able to know more about Tiago Forte's building a second brain concept. And aslo Hiran, for creating a framework upon which I could start this project.
